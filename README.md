# Access Control Kit

> A high-performance, strongly-typed, developer-first authorization and RBAC library designed for modern TypeScript and JavaScript applications.

---

## 📦 Packages in this Monorepo

| Package | Version | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [`@access-control-kit/core`](/packages/core) | **`v0.4.0`** | Core RBAC validation, hierarchical inheritance, direct user overrides, temporary/time-bound permissions, cached wildcard matching, and stateless authorization engine. |

---

## ✨ Features at a Glance

- ⚡ **High Performance**: Permission evaluations resolved in `O(number_of_user_roles)` complexity, avoiding full permission list scans.
- 🎯 **Wildcard Permissions**: Support for flexible patterns (e.g., `*`, `patient.*`, `user.*`) using compiled and cached regular expression matcher.
- 🛡️ **Fail-Safe Validation**: Enforces strict format checks and handles duplicate/missing assets gracefully with custom errors.
- 🎨 **Strict TypeScript Support**: Written in pure TypeScript with absolute type safety and zero dependencies.
- 📦 **Dual Output Bundles**: Distributed with tree-shakeable ESM, CommonJS, and complete TypeScript `.d.ts` definitions.

## 🚀 Quick Start with Core

```typescript
import { AccessControl } from '@access-control-kit/core';

const auth = new AccessControl();

// 1. Register Roles & Permissions
auth.role('Manager');
auth.permission('patient.*');

// 2. Grant permissions to roles
auth.grant('Manager', 'patient.*');

// 3. Fast stateless checking using session roles
const user = { id: 'u1', roles: ['Manager'] };
const allowed = auth.can(user, 'patient.view'); // true
```
